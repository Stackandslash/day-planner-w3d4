## Instructions

Simply open the page, and you'll be presented with an array of hour-long time slots. Just fill in the task for an hour, and click the corresponding button to save that hour. If you leave the site, and come back, your plans will still be waiting for you.

In the future, this app may be modified to cover as many or as few hours as required, possibly depending on user input to rerender at will.
